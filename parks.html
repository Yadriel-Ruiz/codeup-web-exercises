<h1>National Parks FAQ</h1>
<h1>Parks List</h1>
<div id="national-parks-yellowstone-div">
    <h3 id="national-parks-yellowstone-heading">Yellowstone</h3>
    <ul id="national-park-yellowstone">
        <li><p>World's First National Park: Established in 1872, Yellowstone is not only the first national park in the
            United States but also the first national park in the world. This historic designation paved the way for the
            establishment of protected areas globally.</p></li>
        <li><p>Geothermal Marvels: Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's geothermal features, including the
            famous Old Faithful geyser. The park sits atop a volcanic hotspot, creating a unique landscape of geysers,
            hot springs, and mud pots.</p></li>
        <li><p>Wildlife Paradise: Yellowstone is a wildlife enthusiast's dream. It's one of the last places in the U.S.
            where you can see free-ranging herds of bison and elk. The park is also home to grizzly bears, wolves, and a
            variety of other wildlife species.</p></li>
        <li><p>Super Volcano: Beneath Yellowstone lies a supervolcano, one of the largest active volcanic systems in the
            world. While the chances of a catastrophic eruption are extremely low, the geothermal activity is a
            testament to the park's geological significance.</p></li>
    </ul>

<div id="national-parks-hala-div">
    <h3 id="national-parks-hala-heading">Haleakalā</h3>
    <ul id="state-park-hala">
        <li><p>Spectacular Sunrise: Haleakalā is renowned for its breathtaking sunrise views. Visitors often wake up
            early to witness the sunrise from the summit, where the colors of the sky and the volcanic landscape create
            a surreal and magical experience.</p></li>
        <li><p>Endangered Species: The park is home to several endangered species, including the nēnē (Hawaiian goose),
            which has made a remarkable recovery thanks to conservation efforts. The unique environment of Haleakalā
            provides a sanctuary for these rare species.</p></li>
        <li><p>Martian Landscape: The summit area of Haleakalā has an otherworldly appearance, often likened to the
            surface of Mars. NASA astronauts even trained here in the 1960s to prepare for the lunar landings due to the
            crater's resemblance to the moon's surface.</p></li>
        <li><p>House of the Sun: The name Haleakalā translates to "House of the Sun" in Hawaiian. According to Hawaiian
            mythology, the demigod Maui captured the sun and forced it to slow its journey across the sky, making the
            days longer.</p></li>
    </ul>

<div id="national-parks-crater-div">
    <h3 id="national-parks-crater-heading">Crater Lake</h3>
    <ul id="state-park-crater">
        <li><p>Emerging about 160 feet above the surface of Crater Lake, this 300 foot island resembles a sailing ship.
            The Phantom Ship is composed of weathered andesite pinnacles about 400,000 years old. The formation is
            probably the remains of a filled fissure which was exposed with the caldera collapse of Mount Mazama nearly
            8,000 years ago.

            Depending on the weather conditions, the Phantom Ship seems to appear and disappear from sight, giving the
            formation its otherworldly nickname.</p></li>
        <li><p>Crater Lake has inspired people of all ages for decades. In 1870, William Gladstone Steel — a young child
            from Kansas — read about Crater Lake in the newspaper. Fascinated by this amazing natural wonder, he vowed
            to visit the lake one day. Steel first visited Crater Lake in 1885, traveling by railroad and stagecoach
            before walking another 20 miles to finally view the incredible wonder. After fulfilling his dream, he made
            it his mission to make Crater Lake a national park, protecting and preserving its natural resources for
            generations to come. As a journalist, he naturally wrote about the lake's natural wonders, and soon began
            leading nature hikes so that important figures would be able to see why the wonderful lake should be
            protected. Steel's lobbying led to the designation of Crater Lake National Park as the sixth US National
            Park in 1902, and he became known as the "father of Crater Lake" and a "one man chamber of commerce".</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>You may even know the Mazama Newt more commonly as the Crater Lake Newt - as this species can only be
            found around the national park.</p></li>
        <li><p>At 1,943 feet, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and one of the deepest in the world.
            The
            depths were first explored in 1886 by a group from the U.S. Geological Survey. Their sounding device
            consisted of a lead pipe attached to piano wire. After lowering it into the water at 168 locations around
            the lake, they determined the deepest part was 1,996 feet. Amazingly, this was only 53 feet shy of the
            official depth measurement recorded with multibeam side scan sonar in 2000. Impressive!</p>
